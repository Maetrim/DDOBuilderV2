NEW FEATURE "Auto Backup and Revert": (Requested by MrEkshin)
An Auto-backup feature to recover accidental file changes has been added. It works as follows:
Opening any existing file will create a file in the same location with the same name with ".backup" appended.
This file will be auto deleted if you
    A: Close the software or
    B: Save the current file under a new name
        (which will also create a new auto .backup file using the new name and the setup at the time of save).
    C: Opening any other file will remove any existing .backup file. (One for the new file is created)

Selecting the "Revert to Backup" option in the File menu and saying "YES" will throw away
the current document and reload the .backup version of the file, which would NOT contain
any changes made and saved to the original filename. Its up to YOU to then save the recovered
data at that point!

The Revert option is disabled for any new document until you have done an actual save operation.
