    <TITLE>Developer Diary - How to Maintain the Builder</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<h1>Developer Diary</h1>
<p>Hi peeps, this topic is here assuming I got hit by a bus! Poor me!</p>
<p>Anyway, assuming nothing in the code base is completely broken, it is 
possible to update and maintain the builder (except possibly for items - see later) 
by just modifying data or adding new files loaded by the DDOBuilder which can be found in 
the <b>DataFiles</b> folder.</p>
<p>In this section of the Help I will go into detail on how to update these external 
files to add and expand the software assuming I am no longer here to do it.</p>
</BODY>

<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>All current classes supported by DDOBuilder are stored as external .xml files 
that can be found in the <b>DataFiles\Classes</b> folder. All classes have 
filenames formatted as &lt;class name&gt;.Class.xml. These filenames must pass the 
load filter of "*.class.xml" on program startup to be loaded.</p>
<p>You can edit existing Class files in a text or xml editor to update them, or 
if you are adding a new Class, I recommend that you copy an existing Class file 
that is similar to the new Class, and rename it. Note that the loading code is 
not sensitive to the order of items in the file, so things can be added in any 
order.</p>
<p>A Class can/will contain some or all of the following fields:</p>

<table border="0">

<p>Note that when it comes to Effects, Stances and DCs, any of these defined at the EnhancementTreeItem level and at the Selector sub item level will be applied for any given enhancement. Thus common Effects/Stances/DCs can be defined only once and apply for all sub options in the selector list.</p>
