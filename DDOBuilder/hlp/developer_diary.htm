    <TITLE>Developer Diary - How to Maintain the Builder</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<h1>Developer Diary</h1>
<p>Hi peeps, this topic is here assuming I got hit by a bus! Poor me!</p>
<p>Anyway, assuming nothing in the code base is completely broken, it is 
possible to update and maintain the builder (except possibly for items - see later) 
by just modifying data or adding new files loaded by the DDOBuilder which can be found in 
the <b>DataFiles</b> folder.</p>
<p>In this section of the Help I will go into detail on how to update these external 
files to add and expand the software assuming I am no longer here to do it.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>All current classes supported by DDOBuilder are stored as external .xml files 
that can be found in the <b>DataFiles\Classes</b> folder. All classes have 
filenames formatted as &lt;class name&gt;.Class.xml. These filenames must pass the 
load filter of "*.class.xml" on program startup to be loaded.</p>
<p>You can edit existing Class files in a text or xml editor to update them, or 
if you are adding a new Class, I recommend that you copy an existing Class file 
that is similar to the new Class, and rename it. Note that the loading code is 
not sensitive to the order of items in the file, so things can be added in any 
order.</p>
<p>A Class can/will contain some or all of the following fields:</p>

<table border="0">

<h2>Effect Stacking</h2>
<p>Effect stacking can be tricky depending on the sources for a given values. 
A typical tricky example are bonuses to SpellPower depending of which of several 
enhancement options have been selected. For example The Draconic Incarnation tree 
adds spell power to the Spell Power associated with the select Dragon type. To avoid 
difficult setups I have in the past used odd/even stack counts to get values to resolve 
    correctly. By default the UI will now list an effect if it resolves to a 0 value 
    (there is a development option in th UI to force it to list them). To get values to 
    apply only to a specific spell power, effects for all spell powers are present which 
    always give 2 stacks when applied, thus an enhancement which gives a single stack only 
    will push the stacking onto odd numbering stacks vs even. If the <font color="#DC143C">&lt;Amount size="x"&gt;[valueEven] [ValueOdd]...[ValueEven] [ValueOdd]&lt;/Amount&gt;</font> vector has 0 values for every [ValueEven] field it has no effect, while the [ValueOdd] fields specify the correct value for the selected Odd enhancement.</p>
    <p>Note that all the effects my have the same <b>DisplayName</b> field to cause them to stack.</p>
