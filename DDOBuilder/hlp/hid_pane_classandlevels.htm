<p>This pane allows you to set your total level, Class levels and
Feats at the same time. Use the class drop lists available at the
top left of the pane to select the classes your build requires, or
click on an Unknown class icon at any level.</p>

<p><img src="Images/ClassAndLevelsPaneMenu.png" width="355" height="593"></p>

<p>Class Selection Menu displayed during Class selection. Note
that Class selection options can be restricted due to various
factors:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Class has Alignment restrictions and your currently
        selected Alignment does not match. See the <A HREF="main_pane.htm">Main View</A> to set your Alignment</li>
    <li>The Class is Archetype restricted. You cannot take a Base
        class (e.g. Monk) and an Archetype class (Dragon
        Disciple) which are both variants of the same class in
        the same build.</li>
</ul>

<p>Archetype classes are listed alphabetically under the base
class name.</p>

<p>Once you have at least 1 class selected, you will be able to
select additional classes up to a maximum of 3.</p>

<p>When you select a Class choice, all levels currently set to
&#147;Unknown&#148; will be set to that Class type. Changing a
Class selection, will change all levels of the previous Class to
the new Class. When you have your classes selected, you can set
the class you want at any specific level by clicking on that
levels Class column. The currently trained Class for that level
has the Class icon displayed. </p>

<p><img src="Images/ClassAndLevelsPaneClass.png" width="241"
height="173"></p>

<p>In this picture, clicking the green area would set level 1 to
the Fighter Class, the Orange regions would set the relevant
levels to the Artificer Class and the yellow to the Wizard Class.</p>

<p>As Class selections are made, available feat slots are
updated. To save on screen real-estate, Class levels with no
available feat selections are shown half size.</p>

<p>Feat selections will be preserved where possible during Class
changes. This means that they will be moved to an earlier / later
feat selection slot if they can be. If the feat cannot be moved a
revocation Log entry will be added.</p>

<p>To select or change a Feat, left click that Feat option and a
drop list combo box will be displayed with available Feat
selections. When changing a Feat the currently selected Feat will
start selected by default.</p>

<p>The control also shows the base BAB and Ability values your
build has at the given level, as these values can explicitly
affect which Feat selections are available.</p>

<p>You can mouse over a selected Feat or Class section to get
access to a tooltip.</p>

<p>You can Middle click a trained Feat and select an Alternate
option through the drop list combo method. Any alternate Feat is
listed but the effects are not applied. The Alternate feat is
listed on the Forum Export. </p>

<p>You can mark a Feat to be ignored and no longer listed by
Right clicking it during Feat selection. The feat will be removed
from the current list and all future lists unless the &#147;Ignore
List Active&#148; option in the toolbar or Edit menu is disabled.
(Feats in the ignore list can be restored by a right click in
this mode).</p>

<p>You can right click a previously selected Feat to remove that
feat from your build.</p>
