    Hi there,

Thanks for still working on the DDOBuilder!

Im playing DDO on and off since release - like most of us I guess. Ive been using the DDOBuilder more and more over the years. Here's some feedback to Version 2.x:

- Dark Mode. Please.
- A way to change font size. I assume this is possible thru Windows (OS), but I dont want to change my general design just for one application.
- Make choices in "Settings" and - to a lesser degree - in the task bar more visible. Icons are small enough, that I have problems easily seeing if the choices are on or off. Checkmarks in Settings would help a lot!
- Just now, I loaded a file from version 17 that I wanted to add another life to. Now all the buttons in "Past Lives and Special Feats" are greyed out and non-interactable with no way for me to find out why. Closing the app and starting it again and loading the file again fixed it.

Thats all for now. Have a nice weekend!

Oh, I forgot:
- Selecting feats is very cumbersome. Mouse scrolling is disorientating. Maybe make several columns? And a search bar?
