    <Description>Smoke Goggles are a drow invention, lenses that have been darkened to allow
their drow wearers to tolerate the light of the sun while on surface raids.
This pair must have belonged to someone important, as it has been further enchanted
to help the wearer locate and strike vulnerable areas on their foes. However,
the darkly tinted lenses may somewhat hinder the normal vision of someone who
is already acclimated to sunlight.</Description>
