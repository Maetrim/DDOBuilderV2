    <Description>These sturdy ice skates have enchanted blades that look like candy canes. In
addition to providing great ankle support, these skates allow you to glide
across icy surfaces with grace and aplomb... and get big air on the ski jump
in the Harbor during the Risia Ice Games! Try out the half pipe in House Phiarlan's
Bogwater Tavern too!</Description>
