    <Description>Believing them the finest of his personal effects, Orcish pirate Captain Dustdyn
last request was that he be put to sea in a burning bark, these boots upon
his feet. Unfortunately for him, his crew were every bit the scurrilous, thieving,
untrustworthy dogs that Captain Dustdyn had been himself, in life.</Description>
