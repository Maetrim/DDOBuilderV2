    <Description>Though the actual origin of this armor is unknown, it is obvious why the orcish
pirate Captain Dustdyn claimed it as his own. Not only is it made of lightweight
mithral, but the joints of this armor have been fitted in a novel way that
allows for a flexibility and freedom of movement unparallelled in most plate
armors. An important consideration when trying to move about on the deck of
a ship, to be sure. Captain Dustdyn seems to have 'improved' this armor further
with his own personal touch, adorning it with skulls and other threatening
motifs.</Description>
