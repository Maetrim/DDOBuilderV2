    <Icon>Quiver_3</Icon>
    <Description>This quiver is completely organic, and is rough and slimy to the touch. It shivers
periodically, and when provoked it will sometimes disgorge arrows of a random
type. Try not to think about where they've been. The quiver will also hold
10 different types of arrow or bolt and can store each type in a stack of up
to 300. Total capacity: 3000.</Description>
