    <Name>Widow Weave Cloak</Name>
    <Icon>Cloak_4</Icon>
    <Description>This cloak is a by-product of the Kar'Thul experimentation on Whisperdoom and
her spawn. The magically altered spiders were found to produce strong silk
imbued with special properties. Months of delicate work and treatment went
into this item's fabrication and few were actually produced. These cloaks were
likely reserved for Kar'Thul of high regard.</Description>
