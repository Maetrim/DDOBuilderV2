    <Description>Gnomes are small, clever, and insatiably curious, yet not as strong as others.
They gain bonuses vs. giants, bonuses with and against illusions, are hard to
hit due to their small size, and have a general affinity with magical devices.

Gnomes love magic, inventions, and secrets. Often skilled with illusions and
mercantile ventures, many gnomes dabble in magic of one kind or another, though
some are skilled with light hammers and similar weapons.</Description>
