    <Description>Half-Elves are a cross between humans and elves, so Half-Elves have a good blend
of human versatility and elven sensibility and have access to both race's
enhancements and racial-specific equipment. Half-Elves don't have a favored
class, they can do well in any class and are also naturals at social interaction
and can use social skills more often than the other races, an advantage in
managing the battle and assisting their party. They may also dabble with an
additional class ability using the Dilettante feat, making them even more
diverse and self-sufficient.</Description>
