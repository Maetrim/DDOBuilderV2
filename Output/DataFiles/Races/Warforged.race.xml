    <Description>Warforged are a race of sentient constructs built to battle in the Last War.
The Warforged body is covered by plating, giving it an inherent AC bonus, but
preventing the wearing of other armor. Healing spells have their benefits
reduced by half when cast on Warforged. Only the arcane repair spells heal
Warforged without any reduction. Warforged can improve their armor class using 
he Adamantine Body and Mithral Body feats. Warforged can also gain additional
abilities and customize their appearance by using docents.</Description>
